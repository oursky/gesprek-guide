# Connect with Whatsapp

With Gesprek, you can easily integrate with Whatsapp. After our team create a new account for your company, we will need these two things to help you setup the Whatsapp integration with our system:


1. Twilio Number
2. Facebook Business Manager Account ID

After your number is approved by Whatsapp, you will have a business account. It means that you are able to send direct message or use a templated notifications. 


### Whatsapp Template Messages

Whatsapp API only allows you to respond to customers within 24 hours, that means you cannot send a message to a customer if he hasn't message you in the last 24 hours.

However, Gesprek can help you get pre-approval with Whatapp on message templates, and you can send these message templates to customers no matter if they were in touch with you last 24 hours or not.

Your WhatsApp message templates must fall into one of the following categories. Templates that do not align clearly with these template types are more likely to be rejected by WhatsApp in the template approval process described below.


* **Account Update:** Let customers know about updates or changes to their accounts.
* **Alert Update:** Send important updates or news to customers.
* **Appointment Update:** Send confirmations, reminders, or other updates to customers about their appointments.
* **Auto-Reply:** Send auto-replies to customers when your business isn't online or available to respond right away.
* **Issue Resolution:** Respond to questions, concerns, or feedback from customers about your business.
* **Payment Update:** Send a message to customers about their payment.
* **Personal Finance Update:** Send a message to customers about their personal finances.
* **Reservation Update:** Send confirmations, reminders, or other updates to customers about their reservations.
* **Shipping Update:** Send shipping updates to customers about their orders.
* **Ticket Update:** Send ticketing information or updates to customers.
* **Transportation Update:** Send transportation information or updates to customers.


Here are some examples of how pre-approved whatsapp template messages look like:


* I was able to do some follow-up based on our previous conversation, and I’ve found the answer to your question about our refund policy. If you’d like to continue our conversation, please say ‘yes’.
* Thank you for your reservation at Skygear. We look forward to seeing you on 1st of August. You can check in between 13.00 - 17.00. If you come before or after these times, you can reach us at 12345678. See you soon!
